###### 1. Spatial statistics and influencing factors of the novel coronavirus (By: Yongzhu Xiong, Yunpeng Wang, Feng Chen, Mingyong Zhu)


a. Aim of study
- To understand spatio-temporal dynamic characteristics of covid-19

b. Methodology
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moranâ€™s I)
  - Find out if study area and its neighbors had significant global and local spatial autocorrelation characteristics
- Statistical correlation
   - Find out correlation between cases at prefecture level and county level, plus other indication (population, economy, environmental, etc)
   
c. Learning Points
- Spatial scale significantly affected global spatial autocorrelation of NCP epidemic
  - Cases at provincial level, prefecture and county level has significant local spatial autocorrelation and clustering characteristics
  - No global spatial autocorrelation at provincial level
- Significant local clustering characteristics
- Not related to natural environment, population and social and economic activities
- Closely related to prevention and control of epidemic

d. Areas of Improvement
- The research only focus on mainly 1 methodology, which is autocorrelation analysis
